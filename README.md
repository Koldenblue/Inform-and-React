# INFORM AND REACT
![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20License-green)


## CONCEPT

This application was designed with the American voter in mind that would like to make their vote count, but does not have the necessary information in order to make an informed decision.  In this app, the user will be able to enter their address upon signup, have that address saved in their login profile, and have their local representatives displayed, along with other address-driven functionality.  The user will also be provided with information on local propositions and candidates.      


## USAGE

This application utilized the Google Civic Information API and Propublica API in order to produce a unique user experience across 3 webpages and 8 website sections.  In the home/landing page, the user is presented with a navigation bar with the following sections:

<p>Home</p>
<p>Countdown</p>
<p>Local Representatives</p>
<p>Key Races</p>
<p>Propositions</p>
<p>Election Information</p>
<p>Videos</p>
<p>Gallery</p>

Upon landing on the sign-up/log-in page page, the user will be asked to sign-up as a member or enter their log-in credentials.  The user will be prompted to enter their address, that will be saved to the user's login profile and will be used to dynamically render address-driven information on the members page.  They will then be redirected to the members page and presented with a navigation bar with the above titles.

## PROCESS

Two of our greatest strengths were our ability to communicate and collaborate.  We were able to take advantage of each group member's specializations and unique skillsets.  It was this concept that allowed us to assign and manage tasks within the project effectively.  If a group member didn't understand or was overwhelmed by a task, we quickly called a meeting to resolve those issues.  We adapted to each member's interests with respect to assignments and deliverables.  We found that we worked more effectively when we were able to choose work that interested us, rather than relying on random assignment.  We had a review session for virtually every push to GitHub, and went over the changes to the code several times daily as a group.  This way, we were able to review pull requests and merge conflicts as group before merging from branches to the master.  We have a mutual respect for one another, and feel that we collectively complement each other nicely.  We faced and overcame so many challenges because of our mutual respect for one another, ability to compromise, and understanding of our diverse experiences and opinions.  


## CHALLENGES

Using React was one of the toughest challenges that we faced on this project.  Initially, we wanted to use a Bootstrap template that utilized JQuery for our main website template.  However, we quickly discovered that React and JQuery were not able to coexist in most of our pivotal functions.  We found that Bootstrap templates are not very prominent in the React world.  In the past, we have started with a Bootstrap template and customized it to our liking.  In this project, we were forced to take individual Bootstrap components and add them one by one, without the ability to logically style each component.  The front-end team was continuously frustrated with the rendering of sections, images, and other components that had illogical and inconsistent behavior.  


## SUCCESSES

We successfully executed a well-designed app that is both highly unique and useful. We were very collaborative and communicated well. We held scrum meetings before starting work on a daily basis to collectively share what we worked on the day before, what we would be working on that day, and any problems that we were facing. By doing this daily, we were able to stay on top of issues and to proactively discuss potential challenges that may be coming down the road. We were also able to utilize Agile methodology to complete small concept pieces of the project in order to test functionality and verify design.  Individually, we all had our internal struggles, ranging from our understanding of React to being burned out due to working too hard.  We are very proud of each team member's overcoming challenges, as well as each team member's ability to support each other in times of need.  

On an individual level, we all came up with some examples of obstacles that we faced, and how we were able to overcome them.

## DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The groundwork has been laid, but there are several enhancements that could greatly improve the user experience:

Development of dashboards showing electoral college maps for current or historical elections, congressional control, house control, or registered (R) or (D) by state.

Development of a section that features upcoming political events (debates, town halls, and rallies) and functionality that would help the user find these events on a map, and provide directions to these events.
